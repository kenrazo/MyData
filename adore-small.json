Founded in 1643, Maison de Cire Trudon crafted candles for the royal court of Versailles. Cire Trudon candles still carry the emblem of King Louis XIV who created the Royal Wax Manufacture in Antony, which once belonged to the Cire Trudon family. With a gold seal inspired by a bas relief on the Royal Wax Manufacture, the Cire Trudon motto is a tribute to the bees that contributed to the Maison Trudon candles throughout the centuries. Though Cire Trudon candles are now made with a more environmentally friendly vegetable wax, you can still read the Latin deo regique laborant\u201d which refers to bees \u201cdoing work for god and king.\u201d&nbsp;How do I care for my Cire Trudon candles?The first time you light your Cire Trudon candle is the most important. Ensure that you leave your candle on until the surface is completely liquid - if the wax is still solid towards the edges, the candle will create a tunnel rather than burning smoothly throughout its life span. Do not allow candle to burn longer than 3 hours.If the wick shifts, reposition it while the wax is still warm, but not hot.When the candle cools, protect its surface with a bell jar or cloche to prevent dust build up.Never leave your candle unattended. Keep candles away from pets and children, and away from draughts and curtains. Protect the surface you burn your candle on with a wooden base or small plate.",
