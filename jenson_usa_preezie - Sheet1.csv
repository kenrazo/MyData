WH001659 12X148 6B MS,"Race Face | Era 30 Carbon 29"" Wheel 12X148 6B Ms","Race Face Era 30 Carbon 29"" Wheel Strong, Compliant, Light, and Snappy An upgraded wheelset on your mountain bike will have significant performance benefits. Carbon fiber wheels are lightweight and strong, and get your bike rolling much faster than aluminum. The Race Face Era 30 Carbon 29"" Wheel has increased compliance that allows just enough lateral rim deflection to keep you glued to your intended line in rough sections. The predictability and efficient tracking lets you focus less on your wheels and more on the trail. The rear wheel's deeper rim profile is built to withstand full-time enduro punishment while staying light enough for agile uphill maneuvers. The Era's lateral stiffness gives a firm and unmistakable carbon snap-back when exiting corners and berms. The rims are tubeless-ready so you can ditch the tubes and add tubeless tape, sealant, and valves for a smoother ride, better traction, and fewer flats.
