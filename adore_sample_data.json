Cire Trudon candles still carry the emblem of King Louis XIV who created the Royal Wax Manufacture in Antony, which once belonged to the Cire Trudon family. With a gold seal inspired by a bas relief on the Royal Wax Manufacture, the Cire Trudon motto is a tribute to the bees that contributed to the Maison Trudon candles throughout the centuries. Though Cire Trudon candles are now made with a more environmentally friendly vegetable wax, you can still read the latin deo regique laborant\u201d which refers to bees \u201cdoing work for god and king.\u201d&nbsp;How do I care for my Cire Trudon candles?The first time you light your Cire Trudon candle is the most important. Ensure that you leave your candle on until the surface is completely liquid - if the wax is still solid towards the edges, the candle will create a tunnel rather than burning smoothly throughout its life span. Do not allow candle to burn longer than 3 hours.If the wick shifts, reposition it while the wax is still warm, but not hot.When the candle cools, protect its surface with a bell jar or cloche to prevent dust build up.Never leave your candle unattended.

    "full_description": "A lush green cologne with notes of pine and cedar.&nbsp;Imagine the most sophisticated, bright, green scent possible, and you're probably most of the way to Cire Trudon II (Deux). This cologne is like cut grass, if cut grass was wearing a perfectly tailored tuxedo. Equally lush on any gender, this scent is natural, sensual and moreish. It's new life, it's a forest at dawn. A fragrance that will transport you and ground you, if just for a minute.&nbsp;What are the notes of Cire Trudon II (Deux)?&nbsp;Head: Green leaves, bitter orange&nbsp;Heart: Pine, pepper, juniperBase: Cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran&nbsp;What else do I need to know about Cire Trudon II (Deux)?Cire Trudon perfumes are stunning, and they tend to develop a little as you wear them. Select your scent for its heart and base notes, rather than the initial head notes. This will give you a truer idea of how the perfume will smell.&nbsp;This fragrance is a cologne and comes in a 100ml bottle.&nbsp;Cire Trudon: Scents with history&nbsp;Cire Trudon fragrances have the same sense of history, complexity and creativity as their candles. These eau de parfum scents are compelling and unique - you won't be wearing the same perfume as every other person at the bar. They're perfumes for perfume lovers.&nbsp;Once, every royal palace would have a team of staff to care for candles. Founded in 1643, Maison de Cire Trudon crafted candles for the royal court of Versailles. Cire Trudon candles still carry the emblem of King Louis XIV who created the Royal Wax Manufacture in Antony, which once belonged to the Cire Trudon family. With a gold seal inspired by a bas relief on the Royal Wax Manufacture, the Cire Trudon motto is a tribute to the bees that contributed to the Maison Trudon candles throughout the centuries. Though Cire Trudon candles are now made with a more environmentally friendly vegetable wax, you can still read the latin deo regique laborant\u201d which refers to bees \u201cdoing work for god and king.\u201dThe Scent Room PromiseTake a chance on love.

Founded in 1643, Maison de Cire Trudon crafted candles for the royal court of Versailles. Cire Trudon candles still carry the emblem of King Louis XIV who created the Royal Wax Manufacture in Antony, which once belonged to the Cire Trudon family. With a gold seal inspired by a bas relief on the Royal Wax Manufacture, the Cire Trudon motto is a tribute to the bees that contributed to the Maison Trudon candles throughout the centuries. Though Trudon candles are now made with a more environmentally friendly vegetable wax, you can still read the latin deo regique laborant\u201d which refers to bees \u201cdoing work for god and king.\u201dHow do I care for my Trudon candles?The first time you light your Cire Trudon candle is the most important. Ensure that you leave your candle on until the surface is completely liquid - if the wax is still solid towards the edges, the candle will create a tunnel rather than burning smoothly throughout its life span. Do not allow candle to burn longer than 3 hours.If the wick shifts, reposition it while the wax is still warm, but not hot.When the candle cools, protect its surface with a bell jar or cloche to prevent dust build up.Never leave your candle unattended. Keep candles away from pets and children, and away from draughts and curtains. Protect the surface you burn your candle on with a wooden base or small plate.",

At the heart of the festivities, anything becomes possible. The four scented candles convey a royal art de vivre. On the inside, they are covered in 24-carat gold leaf, while on the outside, a royal d\u00e9cor comes to life with stylized chandeliers, pendants and curtains. Marked in hot gold, the decorations frame the gold coat of arms of the Royal Manufactory. On the back of the candle, a decorative chandelier hangs over Serdar G\u00fclg\u00fcn's signature.

Do not set in a draft. Keep away from children, curtains and pets.Should the wick require centering, gently readjust to correct position when the wax is still molten. Allow candle to solidify before relighting.Should any black smoke appear, trim the tip of the wick. It should be clean and no longer than 5mm at all times.Always protect the table or surface on which the candle rests (with a wood or ceramic plate, for example).Do not burn your candle all the way down. Always leave at least 5 mm of non-molten wax at the bottom.Keep your candle in a dry and temperate environment, between 60 and 80\u00b0 F.The first use of your candle should occur within the two first months after its reception.",

    "full_description": "Discover Trudon Absolu Eau de Parfum, a fragrance that pays tribute to the elegance and power of Louis the XIV's reign. Taking inspiration both from the opulence of the court and the timeless beauty of the gardens of Versailles, this scent is an intoxicating blend of fresh citrus, white florals and warming spices, perfectly suited to any gender.Trudon Absolu opens with softly spiced notes of creamy cardamom and earthy saffron, with mandarin bringing a juicy burst of sweetness. Heart notes of incense and iris conjure the extravagance of the palace, while orange blossom absolute nods to the Sun King's love for the flower. Base notes of guaiac wood, cedar and tonka bean bring warmth and lasting depth, creating an addictive scent that celebrates fragrance in its most luxurious form.Trudon Absolu EDP notes:Head: Cardamom, mandarin, saffronHeart: Incense, iris, orange blossom absoluteBase: Guaiac wood, cedar, tonka beanCire Trudon: Scents with history&nbsp;Cire Trudon fragrances have the same sense of history, complexity and creativity as their candles. These eau de parfum scents are compelling and unique - you won't be wearing the same perfume as every other person at the bar. They're perfumes for perfume lovers.&nbsp;Once, every royal palace would have a team of staff to care for candles. Founded in 1643, Maison de Cire Trudon crafted candles for the royal court of Versailles. Cire Trudon candles still carry the emblem of King Louis XIV who created the Royal Wax Manufacture in Antony, which once belonged to the Cire Trudon family. With a gold seal inspired by a bas relief on the Royal Wax Manufacture, the Cire Trudon motto is a tribute to the bees that contributed to the Maison Trudon candles throughout the centuries. Though Cire Trudon candles are now made with a more environmentally friendly vegetable wax, you can still read the latin deo regique laborant\u201d which refers to bees \u201cdoing work for god and king.\u201dThe Scent Room PromiseTake a chance on love. The Scent Room Promise applies to any full size fragrance.Your full-size purchase from Trudon will be accompanied by a complimentary matching fragrance vial. Use this fragrance vial before you unwrap your new fragrance, which allows you to live in your new scent before you have the freedom to unwrap the full size, or return.If it's not a perfect match for you, we accept returns on any unopened full size purchase from The Scent Room.
