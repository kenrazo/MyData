<g:title>Majyk Equipe Glide XC Hind Boots - Large</g:title>
<g:description>Majyk Equipe Glide XC Hind Boots – Next-Level Protection for Cross-Country

Engineered for elite eventers, the Majyk Equipe Glide XC Hind Boots are the result of three years of innovation, combining cutting-edge technology with unmatched comfort.

At the core of the design is the DRS Safety System – a chamfered outer guard that glides over obstacles, reducing friction and preventing unnecessary impact. Backed by ARTi-LAGE impact protection, these boots absorb and disperse shock, keeping your horse’s hind legs protected during the toughest XC runs.

The neoprene-free foam liner offers maximum breathability and comfort, helping regulate temperature even under pressure. Finished with covered TPU straps for secure, easy adjustment and a sleek, modern look.

Built to perform. Made to last.

<g:title>Bombers Loose Ring Mchardy - 145mm - B16</g:title>
<g:description>The Loose Ring allows for immediate release and relief from tongue and bar pressure. The bit is immediately reset to a neutral position in the horse&apos;s mouth.

A horse shaking its head when bit pressure is applied or its tongue trying to escape the bit are classic signs the horse has a sensitive tongue. With this in mind the McHardy was created, it has a medium port creating space for the tongue relieving pressure. The Buster Roller in the middle increases bar pressure and as a result lifting the horse&apos;s head and giving more control.</g:description>

<g:title>Bombers Loose Ring Mchardy - 130mm - B14</g:title>
<g:description>The Loose Ring allows for immediate release and relief from tongue and bar pressure. The bit is immediately reset to a neutral position in the horse&apos;s mouth.

A horse shaking its head when bit pressure is applied or its tongue trying to escape the bit are classic signs the horse has a sensitive tongue. With this in mind the McHardy was created, it has a medium port creating space for the tongue relieving pressure. The Buster Roller in the middle increases bar pressure and as a result lifting the horse&apos;s head and giving more control.</g:description>

<g:title>KEP Endurance Shine Helmet - White - Medium (51cm-58cm)</g:title>
<g:description>KEP Endurance Shine Helmet

The main feature of the KEP ENDURANCE helmet is the ease with which air circulates inside. The unique positioning of the holes (to the front and rear of the helmet) and the construction techniques used ensure unrivalled internal coolness, as well as superior safety. This combination of features makes this model perfect for endurance riding and for all disciplines where lightness and air circulation make all the difference in terms of comfort and performance, such as horseball, show jumping, nature tourism and trekking.

This helmet is also ideal for those who go riding to relax or simply to enjoy being in contact with nature. The outer shell is made from lightweight and very resistant ABS.

The KEP AIR CONTROL SYSTEM ensures optimal ventilation by controlling the internal temperature and circulation of air, which flows through special channels in the polystyrene. The eco-leather strap with five attachment points is hypoallergenic and extremely comfortable, helping to avoid skin irritation. The internal Coolmax® lining is detachable and can be washed by hand in cold water or in the washing machine at 30°C.

The helmet is customisable (airbrushing by hand or other techniques) and is available in two colours to suit every rider&apos;s tastes. Weight: +/- 580 grams.

100% designed and made in Italy.

Fitted with padded removable inserts, the size of the helmet can be adjusted; accordingly, one KEP Medium Skull is capable of fitting sizes between 51cm-58cm, and a large skull from 59cm-62cm.

Please notify us by email the required size liner for your KEP Helmet. Thank you</g:description>

<g:title>KEP Cromo 2.0 Shine Helmet - Navy - Medium (51cm-58cm)</g:title>
<g:description>KEP Cromo 2.0 Shine Helmet

The CROMO 2.0 model is the evolution of the Cromo helmet. An innovative mechanical interlocking system allows the rider to replace both the front and rear inserts and the visor in just few simple steps. The outer shell is both lightweight and resistant thanks to the polycarbonate in-moulding design. The aggressive and elegant ventilation grille is available with both colour contrast and tone-on-tone finishes.

The KEP AIR CONTROL SYSTEM is enhanced with additional ventilation slits at the back, to ensure greater breathability and better internal temperature control. The hand-stitched genuine leather strap maintains the five attachment points for a more stable fit. The new padding, with improved comfort and breathability, is in soft fabric made from eco-green raw materials. It can still be removed and hand washed or machine washed at 30°.

CROMO 2.0 is fitted with an integrated microchip, positioned under the front insert, to which you can upload the rider&apos;s health details using the KEP App. In case of need, this can help speed up the provision of first aid.

Every helmet also comes with a jockey visor. Weight: 500 g size M - 535 g size L

You can customize your unique helmet with gorgeous freehand airbrushing or other techniques. Also available in different finishes and colour variations, CROMO 2.0 gives the rider access to further independent customization options, even after purchase.

100% designed and made in Italy.

<g:title>KEP Cromo 2.0 Textile Helmet - Black - Large (59cm-62cm)</g:title>
<g:description>KEP Cromo 2.0 Textile Helmet

The CROMO 2.0 model is the evolution of the Cromo helmet. An innovative mechanical interlocking system allows the rider to replace both the front and rear inserts and the visor in just few simple steps. The outer shell is both lightweight and resistant thanks to the polycarbonate in-moulding design. The aggressive and elegant ventilation grille is available with both colour contrast and tone-on-tone finishes.

The KEP AIR CONTROL SYSTEM is enhanced with additional ventilation slits at the back, to ensure greater breathability and better internal temperature control. The hand-stitched genuine leather strap maintains the five attachment points for a more stable fit. The new padding, with improved comfort and breathability, is in soft fabric made from eco-green raw materials. It can still be removed and hand washed or machine washed at 30°. CROMO 2.0 is fitted with an integrated microchip, positioned under the front insert, to which you can upload the rider&apos;s health details using the KEP App. In case of need, this can help speed up the provision of first aid.

Every helmet also comes with a jockey visor. Weight: 500 g size M - 535 g size L

You can customize your unique helmet with gorgeous freehand airbrushing or other techniques. Also available in different finishes and colour variations, CROMO 2.0 gives the rider access to further independent customization options, even after purchase.

100% designed and made in Italy.

Fitted with padded removable inserts, the size of the helmet can be adjusted; accordingly, one KEP Medium Skull is capable of fitting sizes between 51cm-58cm, and a large skull from 59cm-62cm.

Please notify us by email the required size liner for your KEP Helmet. Thank you</g:description>

<g:title>KEP Smart Jockey Helmet - Black - Large (59cm-62cm)</g:title>
<g:description>KEP Smart Jockey Helmet

KEP SMART Jockey is the entry level helmet from the KEP ITALIA range, designed for those who want to enjoy the features of our products while keeping an eye on their wallet. Extremely light and comfortable, this helmet perfectly combines aesthetics, design, elegance and unique technology, guaranteeing safety, comfort and high performance.

KEP SMART Jockey is perfect for racing, trackwork and all equestrian disciplines and is fitted with no visor and front grille with internal protective, steel mesh.

The outer shell is made from lightweight and very resistant ABS. The KEP AIR CONTROL SYSTEM ensures optimal ventilation by controlling the internal temperature and circulation of air, which flows through special channels in the polystyrene. The eco-leather strap with five attachment points is hypoallergenic and extremely comfortable, helping to avoid skin irritation. The internal Coolmax® lining is detachable and can be washed by hand in cold water or in the washing machine at 30°C.

The helmet is customisable (airbrushing by hand or other techniques) and is available in two colours to suit every rider&apos;s tastes. Weight: 560 grams

100% designed and made in Italy.

Fitted with padded removable inserts, the size of the helmet can be adjusted accordingly; one KEP Medium Skull is capable of fitting sizes between 51cm-58cm, and a large skull from 59cm-62cm.

<g:title>KEP Helmet Cromo 2.0 Liner - 62cm</g:title>
<g:description>KEP Helmet Cromo 2.0 Liner

KEP Italia&apos;s inner lining is a single piece of material and is easy to remove and reposition inside the helmet. It can be washed by hand in cold water or in the washing machine at 30°C.

The fact that the lining corresponds to the rider&apos;s head size means that riders who alternate between wearing their hair loose or tied up can use two interchangeable linings of different sizes. This feature is also useful for children, whose head size is still growing. Parents can easily buy the next size up and replace a lining that has become too tight, without having to look for a new helmet.

The new inner pad is produced with the use of 100% recycled raw materials, thus contributing to the reuse cycle. The Greensoul technology guarantees uncompromising performance of materials with respect for nature.

The padding is only compatible with helmets model CROMO 2.0 and corresponds to the circumference of the rider&apos;s head.

KEP lining is available in 12 sizes, depending on the size of the shell: Medium shell: lining from 51 to 58; Large shell: lining from 59 to 62.</g:description>
